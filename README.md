I built an ml5 SharePoint Framework (SPFx) extension for Classification and Regression Analysis.

[ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.

To get started.

```
       Clone the repository

       git clone https://github.com/Ashot72/ml5-spfx-extension.git
       cd ml5-spfx-extension

       # installs dependencies
       npm install

       # creates release package which should be deployed in SharePoint app catalog
        npm run deploy-prod
```
